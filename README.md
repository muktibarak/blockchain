# blockchain

# This repo essentially provides some walkthrough for writing a blockchain
# I have not separated any concerns and it obviously does not provide any
# architectural concepts. 

# How to spin up the repo and see if its working?
# I am using anaconda navigator and I am using Spider IDE. Anaconda can be 
# downloaded from here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
# We can also use any independent IDE like VS Code, PyCharm etc. 

# Once cloning this repo, we can open the blockchain.py in the Spider and 
# execute it and test from postman or similar tool to test the endpoing.

# /mine_block, full_blockchain and is_valid all three HTTP calls are GET
# calls. We can test this on 127.0.0.1 or  kernel provided host.
